Title: Missing Outcome Data in Health Economic Evaluation
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Andrea", "Gabrio", email = "ucakgab@ucl.ac.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Contains a suite of functions for health economic evaluations with missing outcome data. 
  The package can fit different types of statistical models under a fully Bayesian approach using the software JAGS (which should be installed locally and which is loaded in missingHE via the R package R2jags). 
  Three classes of models can be fitted under a variety of missing data assumptions: selection models, pattern mixture models and hurdle models.
  In addition to model fitting, missingHE provides a set of specialised functions to assess model convergence and summarise the statistical and economic results using different types of measures and graphs. 
  The methods implemented are described in
