\title{An internal function to write BUGS code for bivariate normal model with natural-scaled variables (independence)}
\usage{
normal_model_ind(type)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{Type of missingness mechanism assumed. Choices are Missing Completely At Random (MCAR),
Missing At Random (MAR), Missing Not At Random (MNAR). For 'MNAR' alternative versions are available 
depending on whether the mechanism for only one variable is condiered, that is for the effects (MNAR_eff)
or the costs (MNAR_cost), or also covariates are included either for the effects (MNAR_eff_cov),
the costs (MNAR_cost), or both (MNAR_cov)}
}
\description{
This function writes in the current WD a txt file 
for the bivariate independent normal model with natural-scaled outcome variables.
