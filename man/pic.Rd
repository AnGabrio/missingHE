\description{
Efficient approximate leave-one-out cross validation (LOO), deviance information criterion (DIC) and widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) for Bayesian models, 
calculated on the observed data.
}
\details{
The Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), Leave-One-Out Information Criterion (LOOIC) and the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating 
out-of-sample predictive accuracy from a Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameters. 
DIC is computationally simple to calculate but it is known to have some problems, arising in part from it not being fully Bayesian in that it is based on a point esitmate.
LOOIC can be computationally expensive but can be easily approximated using importance weights that are smoothed by fitting a generalised Pareto distribution to the upper tail 
of the distribution of the importance weights. For more details about the methods used to compute LOOIC see the PSIS-LOO section in \code{\link{loo-package}}.
WAIC is fully Bayesian and closely approximates Bayesian cross-validation. Unlike DIC, WAIC is invariant to parameterisation and also works for singular models. 
In finite cases, WAIC and LOO give similar esitmates, but for influential observations WAIC underestimates the effect of leaving out one observation.
