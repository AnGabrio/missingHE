## Resubmission
* This is a resubmission. In this version I have made the following main changes:

* I added more distributions among which the user can choose to fit the models using the selection, pattern and hurdle functions (including gamma, exponential, weibull, logistic, poisson, negative binomial and bernoulli)

* I added more variables in the dataset "MenSS" built inside the package, including binary and discrete data. 

* I made few other changes to some of the other functions of the package to fix some minor bugs and updated the description of the functions accordingly.

* Updated the version of the package in the DESCRIPTION file to 1.3.2.
