## Resubmission
* This is a resubmission. In this version I have made two main changes:

* I added the choice of using two different restriction methods (CC or AC) to fit pattern mixture models (via the function pattern).

* I added an accessory function for generating different types of graphical posterior predictive checks (function is named ppc) to assess the fit of all three types of models in the package (selection, pattern and hurdle). 

* I made few other changes to some of the other functions of the package to fix some minor bugs and updated the description of the functions accordingly.

* Updated the version of the package in the DESCRIPTION file to 1.2.1.
